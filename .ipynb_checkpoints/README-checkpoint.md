# Iris Dataset Analysis
This project covers **Level 1 tasks** for my internship:
- **Task 1: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
- **Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  
## The Dataset
The dataset contains measurements of iris flowers:
- Sepal length & width
- Petal length & width
- Species type
  
## Task 1: Data Cleaning
-I started by importing pandas and loading the Iris dataset
-After previewing the data, I checked for missing values there weren‚Äôt any
-I found three duplicate rows, removed them, and double-checked to make sure they were gone
-The species names in this dataset are usually clean, but I went ahead and verified them anyway just to be extra sure everything was consistent

## Task 2: EDA
-I began by calculating summary statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation to get a general sense of how the data is spread and centered.

-Then I plotted histograms for each feature to visualize their distributions. This helped me understand the shape of the data ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs skewed, clustered, or evenly spread.
** OBSERVATIONS **
Sepal Length: The distribution is fairly spread out, with most values clustering between 5.0 and 6.5 cm. It shows a slight right skew, meaning a few flowers have longer sepals.
Sepal Width: This feature has a more balanced distribution but with a wider spread. There‚Äôs a gentle left skew, and the values range mostly between 2.5 and 3.5 cm.
Petal Length: The histogram shows a strong right skew ‚Äî most flowers have shorter petals, but a significant number have much longer ones. This reflects the clear species differences.
Petal Width: Similar to petal length, this feature is also right-skewed. Most flowers have narrow petals, but some have much wider ones, again hinting at species variation.

-I used boxplots to compare features across species. These plots made it easy to spot differences in measurements between setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
** OBSERVATIONS **
-Setosa stands out with the smallest petal length and width, and the widest sepal width.
-Virginica has the largest petal dimensions and longest sepals, making it easy to distinguish.
-Versicolor sits in the middle for most features, showing moderate values.
The tight clustering of Setosa‚Äôs petal measurements suggests low variation, while Virginica shows more spread, especially in petal width.

-I used a scatterplot to visualize relationships between features .It gave a clear view of how species cluster based on measurements.
Sepal Length vs Sepal Width
This plot shows how sepal dimensions vary across the three Iris species.
Setosa stands out with wider sepals and shorter lengths ‚Äî its points cluster in the top-left.
Versicolor and Virginica overlap more but Virginica tends to have longer sepals and narrower widths.
Overall, this plot gives a moderate separation between species, especially for Setosa.

Petal Length vs Petal Width
This plot shows a clear separation between species.
Setosa has small petals, its points are tightly clustered in the lower-left corner.
Versicolor sits in the middle with moderate petal size.
Virginica has the largest petals spread out in the upper-right.

-Finally, I built a correlation heatmap to show how strongly the features are related. Petal length and petal width had the highest correlation (0.96) while sepal width had weak negative relationships with the others.
Petal length and petal width show a very strong positive correlation (0.96) meaning they tend to increase together .
Sepal length also has strong positive correlations with both petal length (0.87) and petal width (0.82) suggesting a general growth pattern across flower parts.
Sepal width however shows weak negative correlations with the other features especially petal length (‚Äì0.42) and petal width (‚Äì0.36) indicating it behaves differently .

### üîç Key Insights
- Petal length and petal width are highly correlated (0.96)
- Sepal width shows weak negative correlation with other features
- Species differences are clearly visible in boxplots
